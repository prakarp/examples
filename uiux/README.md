# Project Setup and Code Style

- **Use Angular CLI for project setup** to ensure consistency and adherence to best practices. For code style and conventions, refer to the Angular Style Guide.

## Versioning of Components

- Maintain reusable Angular components in a separate project within your organization, possibly with a demo application for showcasing these components. Version these components separately to facilitate their use across multiple projects.

# Documentation and Comments

## Documentation Standards

- Utilize JSDOC with Markdown for documentation and comments across files and functions. This enhances understanding and maintainability of the codebase.

## Commenting Code

- Apply multi-line comments for each function describing its purpose, and use multiple single-line comments within functions to clarify complex logic. Remember to consider future maintainers who may not have access to the original developers.

## HTML and CSS Comments

- Include comments in HTML templates and CSS stylesheets to explain the structure and styling choices, especially for complex or unusual design decisions.

# User Interface Design

## Stability and Responsiveness

- When a page loads in a Single Page Application (SPA), ensure components load content asynchronously without shifting position on the screen. Maintain the size and relative position of components across versions to avoid disorienting users.

## Form Interaction

- Avoid initializing form fields after the page has loaded to prevent disrupting user input. Group related fields in forms and consider a two-dimensional layout for field groups. Ensure action buttons like "Submit" or "Cancel" are easily accessible and do not require excessive scrolling.

## Toasts and Notifications

- Ensure toasts do not obstruct clickable content. Consider providing a history of toasts for users who wish to view missed notifications.

# Performance and Optimization

## Lazy Loading

- Implement lazy loading for Angular components to improve startup time.

## User Action Feedback

- Never block user actions during page rendering. If an action is not available, prefer to disable (grey out) the control rather than hiding it, to maintain the layout's stability.

# TypeScript and Package Management

## Type Safety and Linting

- Use TypeScript's type system and linters to catch errors early and identify deprecated code.

## Package Management

- Update or upgrade dependencies in `package.json` in a separate branch to thoroughly test changes. For each third-party library, maintain a set of test cases to ensure compatibility and stability.

# CSS Guidelines

## Field Widths and Layouts

- Use consistent field widths based on the most common input lengths. This approach balances uniformity and practicality.

## Feedback Collection

- Collect feedback on user interfaces from a broad audience but ensure the development team aligns on changes that best serve the user experience. Limit the number of changes to reduce the need for excessive testing.

# Internationalization (i18n) and Localization

## Early Integration

- Incorporate i18n into your project from the outset to ensure your application can easily adapt to different languages and regions without significant refactoring.

## Font Choices

- Opt for commonly available, universally readable fonts. This ensures consistency and readability across various operating systems and devices.

# Accessibility

## Font Size and Zoom

- Ensure text is legibly sized, typically not going below 12px on standard (1920x1080) screens. Design your application to be fully functional and readable at various zoom levels.

## Control Size for Fine Motor Skills

- Ensure interactive elements like buttons and form controls are of a sufficient size to be easily clickable.

## CSS Flexibility

- Use responsive CSS frameworks or techniques to ensure your application looks good on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.

## Universal Design Principles

- Adopt universal design principles to ensure your application is accessible to as wide an audience as possible.

## Navigational Clarity and Downloadable Content Naming

- Users should always be aware of their current location within the application. Name files in a way that is descriptive and helpful to the user.

# User Feedback and Interaction

## Clear User Guidance

- Ensure all communications are clear and informative, guiding users on the necessary actions with precision.

## Visual Distinction of Interactive Elements

- Make clickable elements visually distinct to accommodate users who may click on arbitrary locations.

# Design for Color Vision Deficiency

## Color and Pattern Use

- When designing UI elements, include patterns or shapes to ensure information is accessible to color-blind users. This practice helps avoid reliance on color as the sole means of conveying information.
